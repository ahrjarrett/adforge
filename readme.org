Quick feature prototype to explore a possible workflow & UX improvement for contracts.

Ad design can be difficult, especially when /how/ your ad will render is, to a certain extent, out of your control.

This app allows users to live preview their work and see it rendered in a variety of dimensions at once.

The other, more difficult and still incomplete goal, is to take away all guesswork in deciding where and at what scale to crop background images to fit the ~background-position~ of the ad unit in iframe.

Updating the horizontal and vertical offsets will dynamically draw a box on the image, along with optimal x- and y-measurements given its width, height and aspect ratio.

Work in progress.
