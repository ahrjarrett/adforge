* Deployment

Using Amplify UI, merges into ~master~ will automatically deploy.

- Repo: https://github.com/ahrjarrett/portfolio
- Domain: https://portfolio.ahrjarrett.com/

** Backend

Was getting this error: ~Error: aws access credentials not found~

This is because =aws-exports.js= is in =.gitignore= and does not exist in the repo.

When pushing the backend, you need to have a service role created. I followed these instructions exactly (including the name of the role):

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/how-to-service-role-amplify-console.html

** Cloudfront

Set up with a Cloudfront CDN.


* API

My project data is set up to use the AppSync GraphQL backend.

This was generated by doing:

~amplify add api~
